A collection of useful (to me) code snips I use for debugging iOS

** retain_release_debug.h

This was taken from a debug post http://rentzsch.tumblr.com/post/3895140826/retain-release-debugging

Notes: I converted it to a macro, so including it is as simple as

@implementation MyClass
- init {É}

GVC_RETAIN_RELEASE_DEBUG

- otherMethods {É}
@end

When the DEBUG flag is set it will inject retain/release debug messages, but when not set it will add a simple comment.  You will not want to leave it in you code, but if you do at least your product build will not have tonnes of useless logging.
